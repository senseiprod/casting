      "firstGeneration": {
        "question": "How do I create my first voice generation?",
        "answer": "To create your first voice generation: 1) Navigate to the Generation page, 2) Select a voice from our library of 32+ languages, 3) Enter your text (up to 100 characters for free testing), 4) Choose between 'Free Test' or 'Audio Request' tabs, 5) Click 'Generate Speech', 6) Listen to your generated audio. For longer texts or commercial use, you'll need to use our paid service with various payment options including PayPal and bank transfer."
      },
      "freeVsPaid": {
        "question": "What's the difference between Free Test and Audio Request?",
        "answer": "Free Test allows you to generate up to 100 characters of text for free to test voice quality. Audio Request is for longer texts and commercial use, requiring payment. With Audio Request, you can generate unlimited length text, save to projects, and access premium features like voice customization and advanced audio settings."
      },
      "supportedLanguages": {
        "question": "What languages and voices are supported?",
        "answer": "We support over 32 languages including English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Darija (Moroccan Arabic), German, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Turkish, and many more. Each language has multiple voice options with different genders, ages, and styles. For Darija, we offer specialized dialects and performance styles through our Lahajati integration."
      },
      "voiceSelection": {
        "question": "How do I select the best voice for my project?",
        "answer": "Use our voice selection filters to narrow down options by gender, age, language, and voice type. You can preview each voice by clicking the play button. For Darija voices, you can also filter by dialect and performance style. Consider your content type: use professional voices for business content, conversational voices for casual content, and expressive voices for storytelling."
      },
      "voiceCustomization": {
        "question": "Can I customize voice settings like speed and emotion?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can adjust various voice parameters including speed (vitess), emotion (neutral, happy, sad, angry), temperature for naturalness, and sample rate for quality. These settings are available in the voice generation interface and can be saved as presets for future use."
      },
      "paymentMethods": {
        "question": "What payment methods do you accept?",
        "answer": "We accept multiple payment methods: PayPal for instant payments, major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), and bank transfers (virement bancaire). You can also maintain an account balance for convenient usage. All payments are processed securely through our certified payment partners."
      },
      "accountBalance": {
        "question": "How does the account balance system work?",
        "answer": "You can pre-load funds into your account balance for convenient usage. When generating paid content, you can choose to: 1) Use existing balance, 2) Charge more funds to your balance, or 3) Pay directly for the current generation. The minimum charge amount is $10 or the cost of your current generation, whichever is higher. Balance is deducted automatically when you generate audio."
      },
      "pricingCalculation": {
        "question": "How is pricing calculated?",
        "answer": "Pricing is calculated per character of text. The first 100 characters are free for testing. Beyond that, we charge a competitive rate per character (typically $0.05 per character, but may vary by voice type and language). Darija voices may have different pricing. You'll see the exact cost before confirming any paid generation."
      },
      "projectOrganization": {
        "question": "How do I organize my audio generations into projects?",
        "answer": "Create projects to organize your audio generations by topic, client, or campaign. When generating audio, select a project from the dropdown to automatically save your generation there. You can create new projects, view all project audio files, and manage project settings from the Projects page. This helps keep your work organized and easily accessible."
      },
      "audioDownload": {
        "question": "Can I download and share my generated audio files?",
        "answer": "Yes! All your generated audio files are saved in high-quality format and can be downloaded from your project library. You can share files directly or download them for use in other applications. Audio files are stored securely and remain accessible in your account for future reference."
      },
      "darijaSpecial": {
        "question": "What makes Darija (Moroccan Arabic) special in your system?",
        "answer": "Our Darija support is powered by specialized Lahajati integration, offering authentic Moroccan Arabic voices with multiple dialects and performance styles. You can select specific regional dialects and choose performance styles that match your content needs. This provides more natural and culturally appropriate audio for Moroccan audiences."
      },
      "languageSwitching": {
        "question": "How do I switch between different language interfaces?",
        "answer": "The platform supports multiple interface languages. You can switch languages using the language selector in the navigation. This changes both the interface language and affects the default voice language selection. Your language preference is saved to your account for future sessions."
      },
      "audioQualityImprovement": {
        "question": "How can I improve the quality of generated audio?",
        "answer": "To optimize audio quality: 1) Use proper punctuation in your text for natural pauses, 2) Adjust the sample rate (44100 Hz recommended), 3) Fine-tune voice parameters like temperature and speed, 4) Choose high-quality voices marked as premium, 5) Ensure your text is well-formatted without special characters that might cause issues."
      },
      "generationFailure": {
        "question": "Why might my audio generation fail?",
        "answer": "Audio generation might fail due to: 1) Network connectivity issues, 2) Text containing unsupported characters or excessive length, 3) Server overload during peak times, 4) Insufficient account balance for paid generations, 5) Voice service temporary unavailability. Try again with shorter text, check your connection, or contact support if issues persist."
      },
      "accountUpdate": {
        "question": "How do I update my account information and preferences?",
        "answer": "Access your account settings through the sidebar navigation. You can update your profile information, change password, manage notification preferences, update billing information, and set default voice preferences. Changes are saved automatically and apply to future sessions."
      },
      "audioPlayerIssues": {
        "question": "What should I do if the audio player isn't working?",
        "answer": "If the audio player has issues: 1) Check your browser's audio permissions, 2) Try refreshing the page, 3) Clear browser cache and cookies, 4) Try a different browser, 5) Check if your browser supports the audio format, 6) Ensure your device's audio is working. Most modern browsers support our audio player, but some older versions might have compatibility issues."
